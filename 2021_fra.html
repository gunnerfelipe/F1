<h2> Last month in Spain Mercedes beat its rival with a strategic sleight ofhand. So in France there was no hesitation when the chance came to turn the tables<!--Subtitulo-->
    </h2>
    <p style="text-align: right;"><em>[AUTOR AQUI]</em></p> <!--Autor -->
    <p>We just didn’t want to be in the same position as in Barcelona.”Last month in Spain, Christian Horner’s Red Bull squad suffered a deja vu defeat against Mercedes, as Lewis Hamilton charged late on to make a perfect, unexpected and aggressive two-stop strategy work to win a race in which he’d sacrificed track position. At the 2021 French Grand Prix, Horner’s team was not caught out again, as Max Verstappen reversed the late-race drama and
        ultimately triumphed in an engaging contest that was also laced with several familiar themes from other races this season.
        But Verstappen was “caught out” in the opening corners at Paul Ricard. When the lights went out, he did not need to defend on the run down to Turn 1 as he led Hamilton off the line. But just as Verstappen went from exitingthe left-hander to positioning his car left again for the quickly ensuing Turn 2 right, it all went wrong.
        “I don’t think I braked too late,”he later explained/'I just lost a lot of grip suddenly. It was not one moment; it was like three or four. I lost the rear and had to go off the track.”
        Verstappen’s attempts to catch the slide put him on the inside of Turn 2, where he didn’t go around the two arrow-marked blocks deep in the runoff, as required in the race director’s event notes. But the stewards did not investigate this outcome because“it would have been physically impossible to get to that point”, according to Fi race director Michael Masi, who also said it was deemed that Verstappen had “slowed and lost a position and rejoined in a safe manner”, and therefore no further action was necessary.
        As Verstappen slipped off the road, Hamilton roared through Turn 2 and took an unexpected lead, with Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas chasing hard in third place.
        Horner reckoned“the tailwind down to Turn 1 was so strong it caught Max out”, and indeed the Dutchman felt throughout the first stint that he was struggling to keep his RB16B under control at this point, as well as at the corners crossing that tailwind further on in the first sector, before Turn 6, which takes the drivers back on themselves and onto the Mistral Straight.
        As his title rival was somewhat flailing, Hamilton looked to be in total command up front. He’d come across the line at the end of lap one with a 1.5-second lead, and over the race’s next 16 laps he edged away from Verstappen at a rate of 0.1s per lap. But Hamilton was in fact struggling, with his car feeling “just inconsistent all the way around the lap”.
        The conditions on race day were markedly different from the rest of the weekend. Rain on Sunday morning had washed away the rubber previously put down, and track temperatures were 10 degrees lower than they had been in the sun-soaked, critical, FP2 race preparation practice session on Friday afternoon. Come Sunday, cloud cover, strong, swirling winds and the lost rubber were all playing havoc with the drivers’tyre management tactics. Ahead of the opening pitstops, this was really hurting Red Bull.

    <p>As Verstappen lost ground against Hamilton, his mediumcompound starting tyres were wearing out, not only because the unexpected gusts were causing the car to slide, but because of the typical dirty-air effect when following the leader. Team-mate Sergio Perez was also struggling in the conditions — his Red Bull was running fourth, but had rather disappeared from the lead fight.
        During the laps when Hamilton built his lead to a maximum of 3.1s, Perez had fallen back to 10.4s behind the leader, unable to match the top trio’s times.“For the first five or 10 laps the car was pretty much undriveable with the wind,’’Perez explained." We obviously ran less downforce today, so it was pretty hard to keep up behind. But then the wind was getting calmer and the track was getting better, and I started to pick up my rhythm.”
        Red Bull left Perez out until lap 24. But, critically, although he’d lost time to the leaders in the early laps, he was not completely out of position and contention for the podium places, as he had been in Spain. This time, his higher placing took away a relatively simple (if risky) strategy choice for Red Bull’s rival, and would later allow his team to make the race-winning strategy call.
        But before that moment arrived, Mercedes made several small mistakes, which added up considerably. Bottas had pleased his team with his pace across the opening stint — he was just 5.5s behind Hamilton after 16 laps, and generally remained just out of DRS threat behind Verstappen. But on lap 12 he had made a critical error.
        The Finn locked up at the near-90-degree right of Turn 3 and skated straight on, cutting the inside of the Turn 4 left (this was also assessed by the FIA, but it was deemed that the off was punishment enough), shipping 0.9s to Verstappen on that tour. But it was the damage he’d done to his right-front medium that would prove costly.
        Charles Leclerc and Ferrari kicked off the pitstop phase by coming in at the end of lap 14, which was four laps earlier than had been estimated ahead of the race. Mercedes also had to come in earlier than it ideally wanted to because of Bottas’s lock-up and ensuing flatspot. The vibrations he picked up combined with the problem all the drivers had unexpectedly been having since the opening exchanges: the left-front tyre graining, exacerbated at long corners such as Turn 11, caused by the cooler temperatures and refreshed track surface.
        “ [The vibration] was starting to get to levels where we will box the car for reliability concerns,” said Mercedes trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin.“The focus was on making sure that we didn’t have an issue on track with him, so that was why we did it.”
        Bottas pitted at the end of lap 17 to switch to the hard tyres, when Hamilton held a 3.1s lead over Verstappen. Red Bull reacted by bringing its lead car in a lap later, with Verstappen rejoining comfortably in front of Bottas, who’d been 2.7s behind at the end of the lap before he stopped.
        This was something of a surprise, given that Leclerc had been able to jump three places and run a net fifth, having been seventh before stopping, thanks to a powerful undercut given his early stop. But Mercedes was in for a bigger shock yet.

<h3>“WE HAD A SOLID THREE-SECOND GAP TO PROTECT AGAINST THE UNDERCUT, AND THAT WASN’T ENOUGH”</h3>
    <p>Hamilton came in the lap after Verstappen — two laps after Bottas had“triggered the pitstops at the front of the grid”, according to Shovlin. His 2.2s service was 0.1s quicker than the Red Bull’s but, when the Mercedes was racingback up to speed at the pitlane exit, Verstappen was suddenly bearing down on the seven-time champion.
        They raced towards Turn 1, where Verstappen atoned for his earlier error by striving to reach the turn-in point just ahead.
        The lead, suddenly and somewhat shockingly, wasback in the Dutchman’s command. Shovlin, had disappeared. “We can [only] account for about two and a half seconds of the three seconds,” Shovlin added.
        It’s just possible that hitting the gas fractionally later than Verstappen at the pitlane-exit speed-limit line cost Hamilton, who Mercedes had told would have a 1.5s lead and then had to urgently update him that his rival was alongside heading into Turn 1. There was also a 0.4s difference between their overall time spent in the pitlane in Verstappen’s favour, but the undercut underestimation had made the crucial difference, as Verstappen put in an out -lap that was 0.269s quicker than Bottas had just managed.
        “We had a solid three-second gap to protect against the undercut, and that wasn’t enough,’’Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff 1 ater reflected.“And from then on, we were on the back foot.”
        There was indeed more pain to come for Mercedes, but its decision not to bring Hamilton in the lap after Bottas stopped, which surprised Red Bull, was because it was unsure how its opposition was itself reacting to the first, early Black Arrows stop. In the end, by making sure it“went for it”with Verstappen to cover Bottas’s undercut and try to threaten Hamilton, as Horner explained, Red Bull’s timing paid off handsomely.
        Now, though, Red Bull had another tough decision to ace. Hamilton and Bottas were all over Verstappen during the initial laps on the hards, with the Dutchman getting cross with race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase for not giving him the gap to the hotly pursuing world champion when he felt he needed it each time running onto the Mistral Straight — to understand if he had to defend approaching the Turns 8/9 chicane. Lambiase ordered his charge to calm down and weather the storm.
        For the first 10 laps after Hamilton’s stop, the gap between the two leaders never grew beyond 1.2s and was generally well under that. But here, once it was clear that Hamilton was not simply going to storm back into the race lead, Mercedes suggested he think about preservinghis rubber for a late-race attack, likely remembering
        Red Bull’s late-stint rear-tyre woe at Barcelona.

<p>Returning to Horner’s words referring to the Spanish GP, that race’s outcome was firmly on his team’s mind too. By lap 28,“Max was being pushed really hard, he wasn’t able to be managing the tyres”, according to Horner, and so Red Bull weighed up what it thought Mercedes was doingtoo: possibly switchingto atwo-stopper.
    “The feedback from the car was that he didn’t think you’d get to the end,’’Horner explained.“So, the strategist presented the options in front of me and said,'We have got nothing to lose.’ So we pulled the trigger.”
    AndsoVerstappen did what no French GP winner had done since the event returned to the Fi calendar in 2018 — he came in for a second stop. At the end of lap 32, Red Bull fitted a used set of medium s and set him out on a charge to pass three cars and close an 18.2s gap to the first place he’d just given up.
    Here, Perez’s position was crucial. Although Hamilton felt “the only option I really had was to stay out’’and not immediately convert to a two-stopper because“again he was undercutting me, so he would come out ahead and I wouldn’t be able to get past as they were too quick on the straights” Mercedes had actually already decided that wasn’t an option.
    “Converting Lewis to a two- stop wouldn’t have worked the same, because Max only just got us and we would have had to get through Sergio,” Shovlin explained.
    Naturally, this was no problem for the Red Bull. Verstappen’s pace after his second stop was scintillating, as he trimmed roughly two seconds out of Hamilton’s lead on each of the first five times past the pits (on lap 37 he took 2.6s). On lap 35, he’d arrived at Perez’s rear, with the Mexican playing the team game to perfection by getting off the gas between Turns 10 and 11. Considering Perez was also on a different sort of charge, attempting to make his tyre-life offset advantage pay versus Bottas, this was great teamwork from Red Bull, for which Verstappen was grateful.
    But battling past Bottas was by no means a given. Once Verstappen had moved up to third, Bottas was 2.9s adrift of Hamilton, having slipped back from a six-lap stint in DRS range of his team-mate following the Briton’s stop. Eight laps after passing Perez, Verstappen was within a second of reclaiming second, which was now 4.2s adrift of Hamilton, and he didn’t need a second go at getting ahead.
    Verstappen closed in rapidly as the pair ran down the first half of the Mistral Straight. The Red Bull benefited from its Honda engine’s power punch, DRS and the lower overall downforce level the team had opted to race with after trialling two different rearwing specifications in Friday practice.
    Bottas defended the inside line into the Turn 8 left part of the ht. Now he had nine full laps to close the 5.2s gap to Hamilton.
    “The backmarkers were not making it easy to clear them and gain a lot of time every lap,’’said Verstappen. He went from taking 1.8 s per lap out of Hamilton in the first five tours of his surprise third stint (during which he set the race’s fastest lap at 111136.404s) to 0.5s in the time between passing Bottas and catching Hamilton for the race’s decisive moment, as the leader eked out impressively strongtimes onhis ageing hards.

<h3>“THE STRATEGIST GAVE THE OPTIONS AND SAID, ‘WE HAVE GOT NOTHING TO LOSE.’ SO WE PULLED THE TRIGGER”</h3>
<p>Verstappen started the penultimate tour 0.7s behind his title rival and, just as with Bottas, he didn’t need to make two moves. Unlike in Bahrain, where Verstappen’s offset rubber-life advantage in the final stint led to a not-too-dissimilar late surge, his sole passing move stuck.
    Like Bottas, Hamilton moved to defend the inside run to Turn 8, but thought “there’s marbles on the inside”so didn’t“want to make my tyres any worse than they already were”. Verstappen therefore stole further to the left and nipped ahead under braking for the first part of the chicane. As the crowd roared, Hamilton had felt “it was pointless to defend any harder”.“I just had no front end,”he added. “He would have got me either way.”
    Even Red Bull being unable to hear most of Verstappen’s radio messages during his third-stint charge had no impact on an enthralling set of circumstances, rather familiar ones after the 2019 Hungarian GP and 2021 Spanish GP, in which Red Bull, for a change, had won.
    “It was great to get Lewis and it was a little bit of payback for Barcelona earlier in the year with a lap and a half to go,” said Horner.
    Perez had already played his part in giving Red Bull victory in circumstances where it had previously only known defeat against Mercedes, but he wasn’t finished. Between his out-lap and the end of lap 48, he’d homed in on Bottas at a rate of 0.7s per lap, and passed the second Mercedes driver — furious that his team had not also opted to switch to a two-stopper — at Signes four tours from the finish.
    But this was not without controversy as he ran wide exiting the corner, which the stewards investigated but opted not to penalise because “the overtaking manoeuvre had actually been completed”, said Masi, before Perez ran beyond the Signes exit kerbs. Masi added: “Once he did leave the track, the stewards deemed that he gave back any lasting advantage immediately.”
    In the vain hope that Perez would be penalised, Mercedes did not bring Bottas in to chase the fastest lap point on fresh tyres.
    Wolff reckoned his team “got it wrong”on strategy but, really, a two-pronged Red Bull had been the one able to gain through tactics. The winner was also aided by getting“back into a nice balance” on car handling by the middle of the race after “just oversteering a lot in the beginning” in the tricky conditions.
    “It is sweet being the hunter,” Lambiase told Verstappen as he crossed the line, a third season win, from a second 2021 pole, in the bag. Verstappen’s lead of a championship battle for the ages is now 12 points.

    <h3>QUALIFYING</h3>
    <p>Formula 1 qualifying and red-flag interruptions seem impossible to separate of late. But at the French Grand Prix, the suspensions came at the opposite end of qualifying compared to Monaco and did not spoil all three, as in Baku. But they still proved costly to some drivers.
        Yuki Tsunoda lost his AlphaTauri’s rear going too tight over the kerbs at the first corner and went backwards into the tyre barrier behind Turn 2. That led to a 10-minute delay and, with 22 seconds of the restarted QI remaining, it was then stopped early after Mick Schumacher also went off backwards into the wall - this time at the long, ever-tightening Turn 6 right that was being policed for track-limits violations. His crash preserved his first Fl career Q2 progression, although he’d play no part in it. That conclusion did cost Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll, who had lost his first lap - good enough for a QI top-10 - for runningtoo wide in Turn 6 and had abandoned his first attempt to set a time in the final minutes of qualifying’s first section. The red flag on his last lap dumped him out in 19th, without a representative time set.
        Once the top 10 all made it through to Q3 on the medium tyres in Q2 - a change required for the best race strategy that cost Alpine’s Esteban Ocon, who was knocked out in 11th by 0.121s - they returned to softs for the pole shootout.
        Here, Max Verstappen reigned supreme. He’d laid down a marker by topping FP3 by 0.747s over Valtteri Bottas, but things were naturally closer in qualifying. On his first Q3 run he delivered a lm30.325s, which put him 0.386s clear of Lewis Hamilton, suddenly rising to the fore having been the second Mercedes throughout practice. Hamilton had taken a set-up decision to put his W12 essentially back to where it had been at the start of Friday practice after being “really uncomfortable with the balance”, and “making all these changes back and forth” throughout the weekend’s first three sessions, and on the final fliers he ended up bettering that time. But Verstappen had already put it out of reach with a lm29.990s, 0.258s clear of the world champion.
        “It’s a general understanding of the track,” Verstappen said of his gains between Q3 laps. “We did two runs with the medium in Q2, so then you go out in Q3 on the soft and I think you’re always a tiny bit under the potential in your first run. And then, on the second run, you know where you left a bit of lap time so you’re just gaining on every corner, just a tiny bit. That’s where the lap time comes from.”</p>
</aside>
<h3>McLaren strategy SPLIT NETS 5-6 FINISH</h3>
<p>McLaren split its pitstop strategies in France before Lando Norris headed home Daniel Ricciardo in a 5-6 for the team.
    Norris had endured a poor start from eighth on the grid that shuffled him behind Ricciardo, but the two showed good pace after a second-lap squabble into Turn 1, and were able to make up ground as Fernando Alonso and Charles Leclerc began to reach the end of their tyre life.
    Ricciardo pitted on lap 16, falling behind Leclerc again, but possessed good pace to make his way back up the order while maintaining his tyres. Norris waited until lap 24 before he collected hard Pirellis, falling to 14th. But he managed to cruise through the field with relative ease after that, until he reached Pierre Gasly.
    Norris attempted a move around the outside of Le Beausset, but hadn’t expected the Frenchman to try to hold the inside line, and Gasly kept 10th position by running off track. Norris eventually cleared the AlphaTauri with DRS down the Mistral Straight on the next lap, and later picked off Carlos Sainz Jr to get back on terms with Ricciardo.
    Ricciardo did not impede Norris as he came past with DRS into the chicane on lap 33, and they went on to claim fifth and sixth after the Aston Martins pitted, although Ricciardo just held on after dealing with Gasly and Alonso in the final laps.</p>
    <h3>Tyre management struggles drop Ferrari out of points</h3>
    <p>Ferrari left Paul Ricard empty-handed after both Carlos Sainz Jr and Charles Leclerc struggled to manage their tyres and slumped out of the points.
        Ferrari looked set to pull further clear of McLaren in the constructors’ championship when Sainz led the midfield in qualifying to take fifth on the grid, and then Leclerc undercut Daniel Ricciardo and Pierre Gasly at the first round of pitstops.
        But both Ferrari drivers quickly dropped back as they struggled with the hard tyres graining. Sainz was passed by Lando Norris, Gasly, Fernando Alonso, Sebastian Vettel and Lance Stroll through the second stint, claiming afterwards that his tyre wear was twice as bad as those around him.
        “Cars that yesterday we were half a second quicker than, like the McLarens, towards the end of the race, they were two seconds faster per lap,”
        said Sainz. He crossed the line 11th, while Ferrari’s decision to switch Leclerc to a two-stop strategy failed to pay off when he then struggled with blue flags. He finished 16th, calling it “one of the most difficult races of my time in Formula 1”.
        Ferrari explained that a narrow working range for its front tyres had led to its struggles over the long runs, leaving it with work to do to understand the issue. “We struggle a lot more with graining and with front wear than our competitors,” said Sainz. “We are trying to understand why we have such a narrow window.”
        But team principal Mattia Binotto was uncertain that the issue could be totally resolved on the Ferrari SF21. “We may improve the situation, but to solve it, I think we need to have some hardware change which is not possible with the regulations,” he said.</p>
        <h3>Russell comes home 12th after ‘best ever race’ with Williams</h3>
        <p>George Russell lifted Williams back up to ninth in the constructors’championship with a charge to 12th in France.
            After running 18th early on following a poor start, Russell jumped Esteban Ocon, Kimi Raikkonen and Antonio Giovinazzi on the pit undercut before also gaining a place when Charles Leclerc pitted a second time.
            stages, passing for 12th with three laps to go. “Finishing 12th on merit, I would go as far as saying that is probably our best ever race together [with Williams],” said Russell. “It’s a shame nothing happened in front [so he could score a point].”
            AlphaTauri driver Tsunoda started from the pitlane after taking a new floor and gearbox following his Q1 crash, but overcut the hard-compound starters to finish 13th, fending off Ocon on the last lap.</p>
            <h3>ASTON MARTIN MAKES LONG STINTS WORK</h3>
            <p>Lance Stroll’s high-speed Baku tyre failure occurred as the Canadian was trying to make a long hard-tyre stint work out. But despite Pirelli increasing the tyre pressures for the subsequent French Grand Prix, Aston was still able to make another long stint on the white-walled compound work out for both drivers.
                Sebastian Vettel ran as high as fifth as the cars ahead of him diced between earlier stops or switching to two-stop strategies (Charles Leclerc), and was able to set consistently good lap times on a well-worn set of tyres. The four-time world champion eventually pitted for mediums on lap 37, and was able to claim ninth from Carlos Sainz Jr with 10 laps to go as the Ferraris struggled to contend with the higher-than-expected tyre wear.
                Stroll, meanwhile, had to recover from being unable to set a lap in qualifying, and managed to pick his way through the rearguard regulars before shuffling up to sixth from 19th on the grid ahead of his sole pitstop, a lap before Vettel’s. From there, he worked his way past George Russell, Yuki Tsunoda and Sainz to claim 10th, securing Aston Martin another double points finish.
                “I hope that silences the critics that say we’re doing something untoward with the tyres,” said team principal Otmar Szafnauer. “We never have. We just have a good understanding as to what to do.”</p>
                <h3>Q&A FERNDO ALONSO</h3>
                <p><strong>How would you summarise the race?</strong> <br>
                    It was a good Sunday, good points for the team. Another four in the pocket. Started ninth, finished eighth. It’s a good execution of the race and I finished in front of both Ferraris and Aston Martins.</p>
                    <p><strong>You made a good start -is that a strength of you or the car?</strong> <br>
                    It has been my strongest point for 20 years! So why not still now? The starts are that moment of the race that you need to improvise a little bit;
                    you need to be creative. It’s just yourself and your instinct. Now I’m more comfortable with the car - with the start procedure, with the tyres as well. So yeah, happy with the starts so far, but then slowly in the race you fall to your deserved position.
                    <p><strong>What happened at the end of the first stint, with Esteban Ocon behind and the swap discussion?</strong> <br>
                    Obviously we talk about this, that it could be a possibility in the race. Because we started with different tyres, in that moment of the race we can meet. We were stopping on that Russell comes home 12th after ‘best ever race’ with Williams
                    George Russell lifted Williams back up to ninth in the constructors’championship with a charge to 12th in France.

                    lap [18] or in the next lap, so while Esteban was fighting with an Aston Martin, maybe it was not the best moment [to swap]. He was stopping the following lap and actually it was the best decision to give him free air.</p>
                    <p><strong>How were your battles with the Ferraris?</strong><br>
                    There are some circuits that are very hard on tyres, like here, and we had the chance to fight with them, which is nice. We saw in the street circuits that the amountof energy they put on the tyre is a help, and we saw Leclerc on pole in Monaco and Baku, and in some other circuits it’s a disadvantage. So, we benefit from that, but we still need to work on trying to understand this tyre.

<h2>O FIM DE SEMANA</h2>
<H3>ABU DHABI TO CHANGE CIRCUIT LAYOUT FOR GP</H3>
<P>Abu Dhabi’s Yas Marina Circuit is set to be tweaked in a bid to boost overtaking for Formula 1’s season finale in December.
    The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix has regularly faced criticism about the quality of racing since it joined the calendar in 2009, but organisers have now approved plans to make track changes, with work set to begin this summer.
    Two of the chicanes on the track are expected to be removed as part of the revised layout. The current Turns 5/6 chicane before the hairpin that leads onto the back straight will not be used, giving drivers more of a chance to pass into the hairpin or line up a move before the straight.
    A more noticeable change is planned for the Turns 11-14 slow-speed complex, which will be replaced by a long left-hand corner similar to Spoon Curve at Suzuka. Sector 3 remains unchanged.
    Saif Al Noaimi, acting CEO of Abu Dhabi Motorsports Management, said: “We’ve been looking at improving the racing on the track. We’ve been listening to our spectators, the fans, the drivers, Fi and the FIA, and we’ve been working on making some changes, exciting changes, this year to the layout of the track.”.</P>
<H3>Alpine snaps up Ocon for three more years</H3>
<P>Esteban Ocon has become the latest Formula i driver to sew up his long-term future after signing a new three-year contract with Alpine.
    Ocon has impressed through the early part of the 2021 season, prompting Alpine to open talks over a new deal upon the expiry of his current contract at the end of this year. The team • announced last week that Ocon had signed a new three-year agreement, ensuring that he will remain with the squad until the end of the 2024 campaign.
    “It’s a weight off my shoulders, I would say, so I can onlv focus on the performance and what matters, now that the rest is secured,” said Ocon.
    “I feel good in the team, I feel very well integrated, I feel the atmosphere is fantastic and that we are working very nicely. Obviously, we have a great chance of doing good things next year with the new regulations, so it’s definitely a perfect place for me to stay.”
    Alpine CEO Laurent Rossi explained that he wanted a driver locked for the next regulation cycle. “We’ve seen enough of Esteban, we know he is good,”he said/T don’t want to be here again, looking for another driver after two years. Recent past showed that it never really turns the right way — you have a good driver, you want to keep them.”
    Ocon was formerly a Mercedes young driver, and maintains connections to the German manufacturer, which serves as his management team. But his new Alpine contract does not contain any exit clauses that would allow Mercedes to sign him in the next three years.
    “He is a Mercedes-managed driver, that’s about it,” said
    Rossi. “There’s no such clause as Mercedes [to take] him out of the team. No, he stays with us for the next three years.”</P>

        Keep sport out of politics, urges Todt
    </H3>
    <P>
        FIA president Jean Todt says he supports Formula 1 going to countries that have been criticised for their human-rights records, and that he believes motorsport should stay out of politics.
        The addition of Saudi Arabia to the 2021 Fi calendar has raised questions from human-rights groups, while other races such as the Bahrain, Chinese and Russian GPs have also proved controversial.
        Todt said his road-safety role with the United Nations has given him the chance to meet human-rights experts who agreed that Fi should visit such countries.
        “It’s something which is very dear to my heart,” said Todt, “and since now five years I’m very much involved with the UN as secretary general special envoy for road safety. If you see the high-level panei I made on road safety, you have Zeid Al Hussein, a former high commissioner for human rights.
        You have Michelle Bachelet, who is the actual high commissioner for human rights. You have Filippo Grandi, the high commissioner for refugees. So in a way, it’s a privilege
        I have to be discussing with them.
        “Yesterday Stefano [Domenicali] carne to visit me, and T had Jacques Toubon, former justice minister who has been until last year in charge of human rights in France, and I spoke with him about that. And everybody is in favour of having races wherever around the world. I mean, we are a sport. It’s also something I discussed very often with the International Olympic Committee, because they have the same problem. And clearly we consider that sport should not be involved with politics.”
        Todt stressed that the FIA should talk to human-rights groups about the countries that races visit, and suggested that high-profile events give them a chance to highlight issues. “We need to engage with NGOs,” he said. “And I mean good NGOs, like Human Rights Watch, who are proper people, to try to say, ‘What kind of contribution we can give?’
        “You can interpret the way that it helps you. In my opinion, going in those countries gives also the chance for people who are negative about the country to speak, which probably they would not have otherwise. So, as I said, it’s a lot of questions of interpretation. But, for me, I feel right.”
